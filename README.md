### Learning Python
I'll start from scratch and will end at basic knowledge of Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
Feel free to create pull requests to add more files or edit the codes.

But why Python?

-> Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow.

-> Python can handle every job ranging from data mining to website construction to running embedded systems, all in one unified language.

-> Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This statement means that the original program is translated into "something". "The interpreter" then examines
   "something" and performs whatever actions are called for.
